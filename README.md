## Game Structure</a>
After learning how to play the Simon Game; this is how I build the game structure.


<strong><u>Game Setup:</u></strong>

<li>Create an array to store the button colors.
<li>Create an empty array to store randomly generated game pattern.</li>
<li>Create an empty array to store the player's input.</li>
<li>Create a variable to store the current color the player has clicked on.</li>
<li>Create a variable to store game level.</li>
<li>Create a variable store the maximum game level.</li>
<li>Create a variable to store difficulty level.</li>
<li>Create a variable to store the number of lives for the player.</li>
</li>
<br>

<strong><u>Setting up the difficulty level:</u></strong>
<li>Add two additional colors to the colors array for the difficult level.</li>
<li>Allow player to select difficulty level.</li>
<br>

<strong><u>Start game:</u></strong>
<li>Make the game board visible.</li>
<li>Make sure the sound executes when button selected.</li>
<li>Generate random game pattern.</li>
<br>

<strong><u>Player turn:</u></strong>
<li>Create a click event listener for the buttons.</li>
<li>Store player's input to an array.</li>
<li>Play the button animation and sound when clicked.</li>
<li>Check the button clicked is the correct button in the sequence.</li>
<li>If the player clicked on the correct button, go to the next level.</li>
<li>If the player clicked on the wrong button, end the game.</li>
<br>

<strong><u>During Game Play:</u></strong>
<li>Reduce the player's lives by one when they make a mistake.</li>
<li>Reconcile game pattern's input and player's input</li>
<li>Increment game level by 1 if player win current level.</li>
<li>Generate a new random game pattern for every level</li>
<li>Ensure's that the length of the game pattern is equals to the current game level</li>
<br>

<strong><u>Game Won:</u></strong>
<li>If player won, display a winning message and offer the option to play again.</li>
<br>

<strong><u>Game over:</u></strong>
<li>If the player clicked on the wrong button and has no remaining lives, display a game over message and offer the option to play again.</li>
<br>
